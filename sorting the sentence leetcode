Q)      Sortng the sentence
A sentence is a list of words that are separated by a single space with no leading or trailing spaces. Each word consists of lowercase and uppercase English letters.

A sentence can be shuffled by appending the 1-indexed word position to each word then rearranging the words in the sentence.

For example, the sentence "This is a sentence" can be shuffled as "sentence4 a3 is2 This1" or "is2 sentence4 This1 a3".
Given a shuffled sentence s containing no more than 9 words, reconstruct and return the original sentence.


A)    class Solution {
    public String sortSentence(String s) {
        String str[]=s.split(" ");
        String fin[]=new String[str.length];
        for(String a:str) {
            int i= Character.getNumericValue(a.charAt(a.length()-1));    ////// to get the character numeric value
            fin[i-1]=a.substring(0,a.length()-1);
        }
        return String.join(" ",fin);
    }
}
